 Hello ! Welcome to my CFD repository.
 
The objective of this repository is to embark on a computational odyssey where we harness the simplicity of Fenics to navigate the complexities of computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
Fenics stands out as a cutting-edge finite element library, providing a robust framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Its flexibility, efficiency, and user-friendly interface makes it an ideal choice for CFD simulations. By leveraging Fenics, we aim to streamline the process of developing, implementing, and solving CFD problems, empowering both beginners and experts in the field.

I welcome contributions from the community, your input is valuable.

This repository is set up by folders. The title of each folder gives a brief description of what CFD model is solved. In general, each folder will contain one main .py file and one Results folder. The Results folder contains the solution of the variables that is solved in each model and stored in a .pvd & .vtu file later to be analyzed in ParaView.
In the repository there's a folder called 'Mesh' that contains everything related to the mesh. The mesh is generated using Gmsh.

It is worth noting that all the software used is open-source (Python, Fenics, Paraview & Gmsh).
